# MainFlow Task 8 - Recommendation System & Image Classification  

This repository contains **Task 8** of the Data Science Internship at **Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**  

## 📊 Project Overview  
The goal of this task was to explore **Recommendation Systems** and **Deep Learning for Image Classification**.  

### 🔹 Project 1: Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)  
- Built a **movie recommendation system** using **user-item collaborative filtering**.  
- Calculated similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity**.  
- Recommended movies based on user preferences and historical ratings.  

### 🔹 Project 2: Image Classification with CNN  
- Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification.  
- Used **data augmentation** techniques to improve generalization.  
- Evaluated performance using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**.
